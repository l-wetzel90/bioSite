            <h1>Doug Schmidt</h1>
            <h2>The man... the myth... the legend</h2>
            
  	<p class="intro">
                Do you remember the theme song from the Dukes of Hazzard? You know the Good Ol&apos; Boys by Waylon Jennings? Now take that song and put a modern twist on it like Lil Wyte did <a href="https://youtu.be/8jrRpDoqazs">here</a>
                and you have Doug Schmidt. A modern good ol&apos; boy. This man is wise beyond his time. He is ready to help anyone in a heartbeat and not think twice about it. He grew up on a farm in rural Nebraska learning everything he could from his dad. I don&apos;t think there is a time that I came to Doug with a problem he hasn&apos;t been able to help me fix.
	</p>
      	<p>
		Most of the time you can find Doug somewhere in the country. He&apos;s either in the field working, doing something with the many different animals he has adopted, elbows deep in grease working on something or driving to pick some new piece of equipment he just bought. When he has a little free time try looking in a tattoo shop for him.
	</p>
            <p>***Here I will talk some more about Doug after I here from the family I contacted.***</p>
            <p>Pictures are not in order yet or where I want them to be placed. I asked him for some and he told me to take em from facebook.</p>
