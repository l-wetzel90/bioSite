			<p>This is the cleanest I have ever seen Doug while he is at the farm. I bet that didn&apos;t last long
				either.</p>
			<br><br>
			<p><q>I remember one of the first times helping my dad work on equipment at the farm. My dad and brothers
					couldn't reach to put a new fitting and gasket inside a sprayer tank. Dad had me crawl inside to get
					the fitting and gasket in the hole so they could thread the nut on it. After that I was helping dad
					all the time. I was the smallest so I could fit places dad and the other boys couldn't.</q> --Doug
				Schmidt</p>

		<div class="column1of3">
			<p>This man is wise beyond his time. He is ready to help anyone in a heartbeat and not think twice about it.
				He grew up on a farm in rural Nebraska learning everything he could from his dad. I don&apos;t think
				there
				is a time that I came to Doug with a problem he hasn&apos;t been able to help me fix.</p>

			<p>Most of the time you can find Doug somewhere in the country. He&apos;s either in the field working, doing
				something with the many different animals he has adopted, elbows deep in grease working on something or
				driving to pick up some new piece of equipment he just bought. When he has a little free time try
				looking in a tattoo shop for him.</p>

			<p>Doug Schmidt... there is a lot to say about him. To pick a certain thing and talk about it is hard. He is
				always there. Sometimes it may take him a little bit to answer because he is always helping, but he will
				be there. He is very caring individual. I know I wouldn&apos;t be where I am at today if it wasn&apos;t
				for him. The struggles he went through made it possible for him to help me through my struggles.</p>

			<p>He is a teacher. He taught me how to work on vehicles. He wouldn&apos;t just do the work for me, I had to
				start working on something while he was watching an telling me what to do. Hand&apos;s on instruction,
				it&apos;s the best way to learn anything.</p>
